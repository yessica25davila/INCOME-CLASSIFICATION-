# Income Influences: A Logistic Regression Analysis

UCI CENSUS DATA (1994) Oregon State University-Capstone Project | April 2025 - June 2025

This analysis investigates the relationship between demographic and employment factors using 1994 U.S. Census data. The main goal was to understand how factors influenced whether someone earned over $50k annually. I used logistic regression on a dataset from the Machine Learning Repository maintained by the University of California, Irvine (UCI). 

I focused on two key questions: First, is there an association between how many hours someone works per week and whether they earn over $50,000 — after accounting for other variables? The results showed a clear relationship between the two for each additional hour that someone worked per week, the odds of earning over $50,000 increase by about 1.03 times the odds for someone who worked one hour less while holding everything else constant. 

Second, After accounting for age, is there evidence of a difference in the earnings probability of men and women? Here, the odds ratio for men compared to women was 1.02. Meaning, that men had slightly higher odds of earning more than $50,000 compared to women of the same age. Although the difference is modest, it still points to a measurable gap. Why does this matter? This kind of analysis can help guide policies and decisions that aim to promote fairness and efficiency in the labor market. It highlights the role that work hours — and persistent gender differences — can play in income outcomes. 

While the data is from 1994 and may not reflect today’s workforce perfectly, the overall takeaway remains relevant: data-driven insights can help us better understand income disparities and improve employment practices going forward
