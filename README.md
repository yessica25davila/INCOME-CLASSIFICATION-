# Income Influences: A Logistic Regression Analysis

UCI CENSUS DATA (1994) Oregon State University-Capstone Project | April 2025 - June 2025

This analysis investigates the relationship between demographic and employment factors  using 1994 U.S. Census data.

Understand the factors that influence whether individuals earn more than $50,000 annually. 
Logistic regression models were applied to a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

(1) Is there an association between earning over $50,000 and hours worked per week, after accounting for other factors? 
After adjusting for other factors, for each additional hour worked per week, the odds of earning over $50,000 was 1.03 times the odds for someone who works one hour less.

(2) After accounting for age, is there evidence of a difference in the earnings probability of men and women?
The odds ratio for men compared to women was 1.02, meaning that men had 1.02 times the odds of earning over $50,000 than women of the same age.

Analysis supports decisions that promote fairness and efficiency in the labor market. 
Work hours and gender disparities should be considered in income-related workforce planning. 
Data from 1994 is outdated and may not reflect today’s dynamics but results still support data-driven efforts to improve fairness in employment practices.
